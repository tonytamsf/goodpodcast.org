*Engage & Support The Good Podcasts Creators Around The World*

## Audience
1. Primary: Podcast Creators & Their Guests
2. Secondary: Podcast Avid Fans

## Use Cases
1. As a Podcast Creator and Guest(s), I would like to engage in the open with my avid fans.
2. As a Podcast Avid Fan, I would like to support the podcasts I love and engage with the creators on an episode by episode basis.  If I can also engage with their guests, that would be even better!
3. As a guest on a Podcast, I am building a following of my own for my projects/books/own podcast, I would like to leverage the audience for that particular episode.

## 1st Principals
1. All actors in the system are verified, *no* anonymous actors.
2. We care about the good stuff, if you dislike a podcast this is not the place for you to vent.  Plenty of other places for that.
3. We care about quality over quantity.
4. Multi-region, Multi-language.
5. Interactions are API based, UI's, Apps can be built on top
6. Non-profit, incoportated as a not for profit endeavor.
7. We start small, deep and then go broard

## Features
1. Creators can engage how they usually engage via email, Twitter, discord, FB, etc.
2. Easy to integrate without the creators needing to be techies. As an example, we can generate a new RSS feed to proxy their original feed.
3. We want to pay the creators (via Patreon, paypal, venmo)
4. Fans can create depositories for their creators to pick up later.  (For those creators who don't know how to monetize)
5. Open API for podcast apps to integrate into the ecosystem.

## Very Next Steps
1. Create a landing page and get sign ups.
1. Define what is a good podcast?
1. Define rules of conduct.
1. Create the set of API's specs
1. Demo and feature one podcast by hand and test with avid fans and contact one podcast creator with a Patreon account.

## After Next Steps
1. Create a sample webapp, iOS and Android to demonstrate how to integrate successfully into the API
1. Create a URL transformation for 1 Podcast feed.
   1. Metadata (AV, description, contact, pre, post and mid rolls)
   2. Integration into payment systems (paypal, patreon, venmo.. etc)
   3. Fan created kickstarter pages
   4. Portable data/RSS/OPML

## Future steps   
1. Charging for API usage, developers are the 3rd audience.
2. Integration of guest episodes for good podcasts to offer other good podcasts.
3. Sorting episodes not just based on time, but on feature epoisdes, getting started episodes.
